### Practice Programming Question

**Scenario:**  
A car rental service tracks the bookings for up to 50 customers in a one-dimensional (1D) array named `Clients[]`. A two-dimensional (2D) array `Rentals[]` records details of each customer's rental agreement, including:

- vehicle type (integer index)
- number of rental days (integer)
- start date of rental (string in format `DD-MM-YYYY`)
- insurance option chosen (boolean, where `true` indicates insurance was taken)
- total cost of the rental in dollars (two decimal places)

The company offers five types of vehicles, each with a different daily rental rate. Customers can rent a vehicle for a period ranging from 1 to 30 days.

The index of any customer's data in the `Clients` array corresponds to the same index in the `Rentals` array. For example, a client named at index 3 of `Clients[]` would have their rental details at index 3 of `Rentals[]`.

The vehicle options available are:

| Index | Vehicle Type | Daily Rate ($) |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1     | Sedan        | 45.99          |
| 2     | SUV          | 55.99          |
| 3     | Sports Car   | 75.50          |
| 4     | Minivan      | 65.00          |
| 5     | Convertible  | 85.00          |

The data are stored in two 1D arrays named `VehicleType[]` and `DailyRate[]`. The index of the vehicle type and its daily rate in their arrays share the same index number.

**Programming Task:**

Write a program that meets the following requirements:

- input a new client's name, vehicle type, and rental period
- input the start date of rental and ensure it is in the correct format
- check that the number of rental days is valid
- output an error message and require incorrect inputs to be re-entered until they are valid
- calculate the total cost of rental by multiplying the number of days by the daily rate of the vehicle
- if insurance is chosen (indicated by a `true` value), add a fixed insurance cost of $19.99 to the total cost
- store all data in the relevant array
- output the client's rental agreement to include: the name of the client, vehicle type, rental period, start date, insurance status, and the calculated total cost
- continue to accept the next client

You must use pseudocode or program code and add comments to explain how your code works. Assume that the arrays and necessary variables have already been declared.

All inputs and outputs must contain suitable messages, and error handling should be clear and user-friendly.
